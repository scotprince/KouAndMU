        Security
    </p>
    <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information, if any. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a
        closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a
        specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information
        are kept in a secure environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not use cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Links
    </p>
    <p>
        This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be
        aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Surveys & Contests
    </p>
    <p>
        From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notification of Changes
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever material changes are made to the privacy notice specify how you will notify consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other Provisions as Required by Law
    </p>
    <p>
        Numerous other provisions and/or practices may be required as a result of laws, international treaties, or industry practices. It is up to you to determine what additional practices
        must be followed and/or what additional disclosures are required. Please take special notice of the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA),
        which is frequently amended and now includes a disclosure requirement for “Do Not Track” signals.
    </p>

        If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 808-555-1234 or via email at mauiultimate@mailinator.com.
